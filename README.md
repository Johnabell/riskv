# riskv (pronounced 'riskvey')

A RISC-V interpreter written in Rust.

## Status

This project is in early stages and it primarily being embarked upon as a learning exercise.
Feel free to contribute and get involved if you would like to learn more about assembly and RISC-V.

## Provitional plan

- Implement basic model of the processor, instructions, stack and heap (based on a useful subset of all the instructions)
- Implement a parser for RISC-V assembly files
- Interpret and run RISC-V assembly files

## Possible future additions

- A graphical UI for inspecting the current processor state during the execution of a programme
- An assembler to create native RISK-V binaries
